# On docs

In the pantheon of holy knowledge transfer techniques:

1. 🏆 Automation (of outcomes)
  - The Holygrail of full automation may not exist but its worth the questing to find it
  - **Example**:  one command gathers input then runs every app in any environment
2. 👼 Contextual docs/help
  - A slight compromise is when the process/idea largely drives itself, but relevant info is added when its needed
  - **Example**: IF telicent-cli stderr includes "network <sha> not found>" THEN display "Try 'docker network prune'"
  - **Example**: Project repo description should always be up to date
3. 📜 Documentation
  - This is a large compromise
  - Some docs are probably better than nothing, but _sometimes_, even _no docs_ are better than some docs


Then each of these techniques can have holy attributes. For instance:
- conventional/idiomatic: lessen the need for docs, and make editing automation easier). 
- discoverable: docs/help/automation scripts that are easily found are better than those that are hard to find
 
And of course unholy attributes - e.g. dependencies that are not enforced - like test failures that don't block PR


We shouldn't be patting ourselves on the back for creating documentation, we should be celebrating how/when our teammates achieve outcomes
